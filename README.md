<h1>MMath</h1>

MMath is a Maths library I develop to improve my 3D math skills. While studying as a Games programmer at Breda University of Applied Sciences, I realized one day that my maths knowledge was only passable but not actually good. Thus, I decided to improve my skills and quickly realized that studying theoretical maths did nothing except annoy and frustrate me. I lacked the practical side of things, the application of what I learned. And not only did that absence or practical application frustrate me, but it also resulted in very low retention of what I learned. 
</br>
</br>That's how MMath was born.</br>
</br>
MMath is not necessarily geared towards Game Development, as seen from the inclusion of some features that are rarely used in Game Development, like the Vec3D's Scalar-Triple Product. It is intended to be more of an exercise that gives me the practical experience I seek. 
</br>Its ultimate goal is to help me learn more about the 3D Maths needed to be a Games Developer while also letting me walk away with a reusable Maths library for my personal and University projects.


<h2> Features </h2>
Currently, MMath supports the following features:
<ul>
  <li>3D Vectors (including all of the standard arithmetic operations + the Dot, Cross and Scalar-Triple Products)</li>
  <li>3x3 Matrices (including all of the standard arithmetic operations + Determinant and Inverse Calculations)
 </ul>
